# paddle-ball-pygame
This classic game is developed using python pygame library , built from samples from http://programarcadegames.com/?chapter=example_code
Difficulty modes can be chosen to play with automated paddle on one side and with a joystick controlled user paddle, each bounce scores a point
This is very primitive stage can be modified with more graphics.
